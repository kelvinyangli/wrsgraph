# wrsgraph
An r package to check if a given (undirected) graph is a weakly recursively simplicial (wrs).
Since wrs is proved to be equivalent to graph morality and a set of consistent Markov blankets,
then a graph is checking wrs is equivalent to checking morality that is equivalent to checking Markov blanket consistency.
